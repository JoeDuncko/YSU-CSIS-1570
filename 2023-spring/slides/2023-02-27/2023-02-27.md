## Assignment 4 iteration 1s are done

Main issues:

- The difference between selecting classes with `.` and ids with `#`
  - (mostly in the case of `#hero-section`... any ideas why?)
- The `m` typo that should have been `em`

Iterations are due by class on Wednesday

## Assignment 5 was due today

Will hopefully be able to take a look at them today... need to catch up with grading...

### What does "Cascading" mean?

- You can have multiple rulesets, which can override each other in order
- CSS Rules use "specificity" to determine which rules apply
  - Specificity considers...
    - How "close" to the item the rule is written (external > internal > inline)
    - How detailed the selector is (how many selector and what kinds)
    - The order the rules are read (eg, if you have multiple external stylesheets)
- Some rules are inherited from their parents, like font styles
- There's an "emergency use" `!important `key word... do not use it unless you need to patch mistakes in files you cannot edit!

---

## Multiple files

Rules of CSS files `link`ed later override the rules of previously `link`ed ones.

This is great for...

- Having one stylesheet for "global" styles and one for "this page only" styles
- Having one style sheet per "component"
- Overriding styles you don't have the ability to edit directly (ie, Bootstrap or other imported styles)

---

## Visibility

- `visible`
- `hidden`
- - more (mostly for tables)

---

## Position

- "relative" + "absolute"
  - The nearest parent with position: "relative" serves as the container for a child with position: "absolute"
- "fixed" vs "sticky"

---

## Display

- "none"
  - Not to be confused with `visibility: hidden`
- "inline"
- "block"
- "inline-block"
- "grid"
- "flex"
  - Related CSS properties:
    - flex-direction
    - align-elements
    - justify-content

---

  - `box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px red;`
